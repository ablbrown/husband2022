10. Summarize the reaction times with a mean, grouped by expectation. Which took longer?
```{r}
df_maze_critical |>
  group_by(expect) |>
  summarize(avg_rt = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE))
```

11. Did all participants take longer for unexpected nouns?
```{r}
df_maze_critical |>
  group_by(Index, expect) |>
  summarize(part_mean = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = expect,
              values_from = part_mean) |>
  mutate(diff_expec_un = unexpected - expected) |>
  arrange(diff_expec_un)

```
Yes, all except for one!


12. Did older participants have longer reaction times?
```{r}
df_maze |>
  group_by(Index, age) |>
  summarize(meanRT = mean(RT, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = meanRT)) +
